This is a test console application for a Trainee Ruby Dev 
at Evowill. A user is able to monitor his/her expenses, 
create new categories and delete all records.

**I also dumped my db to a SQL file, so it is possible to see the structure.**

______________
<h1>Adding data</h1>

**A user is able to choose any action from the menu.**

<h3>Registration</h3>
By entering some personal date, a person will be registered and saved 
into the database.

<h3>Adding the element (to a new category) </h3>
I added some categories to test the program: Food, Entertainment and
Health. A user can also create his/her own category. 
I'll create a new category, named 'Clothes' and add 'Purple Jeans' in order for you to see how program works.

<h3>Adding the element (to an existing category) </h3>
A user can add a new element to an existing category, in essence, Entertainment.

Let's add a new entity for the test, named 'Yellow Scarf', which
I bought two months ago.
